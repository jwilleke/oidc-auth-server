# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This document provides guidelines for developers and AI agents working on this codebase.

## Before You Start

- Read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for project context and status
- Review [CODE_STANDARDS.md](./CODE_STANDARDS.md) for coding guidelines and guiding principles
- Check [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for security practices
- See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for project structure

## Getting Started

See [README.md](./README.md#quick-start) for setup instructions including prerequisites, cloning, and dependency installation.

## Development Workflow

### Read Project Context First

Before starting work, read `AGENTS.md` to understand:

- Project goals and current status
- Architecture and tech stack
- Known blockers or issues
- Priority tasks

Use the slash command:

```bash
/context
```

### Branch — only if the change needs one

Commit directly to `master` by default. A feature branch plus a pull request is warranted only when
someone other than you will look at the change before it lands; on a single-maintainer repo a
self-opened, self-merged PR reviews nothing. See the Process Constraints in
[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

When a branch *is* warranted:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming: `type/description`

### Make Changes

Follow [CODE_STANDARDS.md](./CODE_STANDARDS.md) for all code conventions including TypeScript strict mode, naming conventions, formatting rules, and the DRY principle.

## Making Changes

### Linting and Formatting

```bash
npm run lint        # Check for issues
npm run lint:fix    # Auto-fix issues
npm run format      # Format with Prettier
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run test              # Run tests
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # Check coverage
```

## Commit Guidelines

All commit messages must follow the format specified in [CODE_STANDARDS.md - Git Commit Messages](./CODE_STANDARDS.md#git-commit-messages).

This includes:

- Conventional commits format (type, scope, description)
- Required types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`
- Pre-commit hooks that enforce linting standards

## Pull Requests

Not the default — see [Branch — only if the change needs one](#branch--only-if-the-change-needs-one).
The checks below apply to a direct commit just as much as to a PR; CI runs on `push` to `master` as
well as on `pull_request`.

### Before Creating a PR

1. Update branch: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/master`
2. Run tests: `npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build`
3. Update [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) if making significant changes

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code follows [CODE_STANDARDS.md](./CODE_STANDARDS.md)
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Commit messages follow [CODE_STANDARDS.md conventions](./CODE_STANDARDS.md#git-commit-messages)
- [ ] [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) updated if applicable

## Code Review Process

- Be respectful and constructive
- Review promptly
- Approve when satisfactory
- All CI checks must pass before merging

## GitHub Issues

One concern per issue. If work has phases or steps, create one issue per phase and express the dependency with GitHub relationships:

- `closes #N` / `fixes #N` — this issue resolves another
- `blocked by #N` — cannot start until N is closed
- `relates to #N` — context link, no hard dependency

Never add "Step 1 / Step 2" or "Phase" headings inside a single issue body.

## Questions?

- Check AGENTS.md for project context
- Read CODE_STANDARDS.md for guidelines
- Open an issue for questions
