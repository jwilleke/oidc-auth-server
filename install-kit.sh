#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-kit.sh — idempotent installer for the mjs agent kit.
#
#   New repo : run in a fresh/empty repo  → drops the kit + seeds starter docs.
#   Upgrade  : run in an existing repo    → updates canonical files, never clobbers your content.
#   Re-run   : safe anytime to pick up a newer kit version.
#
# Usage:
#   install-kit.sh [--dry-run] [--pr] [target-dir]
#   install-kit.sh --retire [--dry-run] [target-dir]
#                                                # target-dir defaults to the current directory
#
# Sync modes:
#   (default)    apply the kit in place, leaving the changes uncommitted for you to review
#   --retire     retire a consumer: it stops receiving the kit, and what the kit owns is
#                removed. Installs nothing. (#66)
#                Removing .github/workflows/kit-sync.yml is what actually stops the
#                behaviour — the workflow lives inside the consumer and fires on push
#                regardless of any list here, so dropping a repo from downstream-repos.json
#                does not stop it. Then the kit-owned files go: every `overwrite` and
#                `overwrite-template` row of kit-files.tsv, the AGENTS.md managed block
#                (everything below KIT:END is preserved), the kit_version stamp in that
#                file's frontmatter, and .agent-kit.json, without
#                which manifest discovery would re-propose the repo on the next sweep.
#                KEPT: create-if-absent files (TODO.md, CLAUDE.md, private/project_log.md)
#                and seed files (issue templates, markdown-lint.yml, .vscode/extensions.json)
#                are the repo's own once written. For overwrite-or-suffix, a repo that owns
#                the plain name keeps it and only the kit's -kit copy is removed.
#   --pr         apply on a `chore/kit-sync-<version>` branch, then commit, push, and open a PR.
#                Requires an authenticated `gh`, an `origin` remote, and a clean working tree.
#                A kit sync rewrites files in a repo whose owner did not initiate the change, so it
#                gets a review point and a single revertable commit rather than landing unannounced.
#                CI runs either way — on `push` as well as `pull_request` — but a PR runs it as a
#                gate BEFORE the change lands instead of a notification after.
#                The PR is left for a human to merge.
#
# Which files are managed, and how, is declared in kit-files.tsv — NOT in this
# script. bin/kit.mjs reads the same file to check a repo, so the installer and
# the checker cannot disagree about what the kit owns.
#
# Behavior per file (kit-files.tsv column 1):
#   overwrite        canonical tool files (.claude/commands, sync-labels.sh, .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc)
#   overwrite-template  overwrite REL every run from templates/<template>
#   overwrite-or-suffix  like overwrite, but if the repo already owns that filename with its own
#                    content, the kit's copy is installed as <name>-kit.<ext> and the repo's file
#                    is left alone. Once suffixed, it stays suffixed in that repo.
#   seed             copied only when absent; source is the same path in the kit
#   create-if-absent copied only when absent; source is templates/<template>
#   managed-block    AGENTS.md boilerplate between <!-- KIT:START/END --> markers
#
# Behaviors that are not per-file lists, and so live in this script:
#   merge            .gitignore — append missing lines only
#   unignore         .gitignore — narrow a blanket `.claude/` ignore (keeps settings.local.json ignored)
#   migrate          docs/project_log.md → private/project_log.md (once)
#   supersede        remove .markdownlint.json in favor of .markdownlint.jsonc
#   retire           delete files the kit no longer ships (old commands, .markdownlint.jsonc).
#                    Note this is per-FILE and unrelated to the --retire flag, which retires a
#                    whole consumer.
#
# Requires: bash, git, awk. (Run utility/sync-labels.sh separately for GitHub labels.)
#           --pr additionally requires the `gh` CLI, authenticated.
#
# Note: macOS ships bash 3.2 — keep this script free of arrays, `mapfile`, and `${var,,}`.
