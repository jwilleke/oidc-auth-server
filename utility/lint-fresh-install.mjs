// lint-fresh-install.mjs — run install-kit.sh into an empty repo and check the result.
//
// utility/lint-templates.mjs lints each template rendered on its own. This lints
// the thing a consumer actually receives: a full install, in file layout, with
// every seeded workflow and issue template present and .gitignore already
// applied. All three failures in issue #49 only appeared at that level —
// on a repo's FIRST use, which is exactly when nobody is watching the build.
//
// Checks:
//   1. every markdown file the install produced passes the kit's own rules
//   2. `private/` is ignored BEFORE private/project_log.md is created, so a
//      stray `git add -A` cannot track the personal journal
//   3. the install is idempotent — a second run changes nothing
//
// Usage: node utility/lint-fresh-install.mjs
