// lint-todo.mjs — enforce the TODO.md band rules that /pstatus only states in prose.
//
// `/pstatus` says a band contains its open items or the absence marker, that the
// file carries no history, and that no reference appears twice. All three were
// prose in a command file, and agents read past prose: jwilleke/mjs-ha's TODO.md
// grew six lines of scanner narrative under an empty P0 band, and this repo's did
// the same on the same day. The operator caught both by reading the file, which
// is not a check.
//
// Rules, in the order they are reported:
//   1. only frontmatter, the H1, band headings and band content exist
//   2. the bands are the expected ones, in the expected order
//   3. a band holds list items OR exactly `*None.*` — never both, never prose
//   4. every item is a link line whose visible number matches its URL
//   5. no issue or PR is referenced twice in the file
//
// Advisory only: it reports and always exits 0. The band rules are a formatting
// convention for a generated file, and a convention that can fail a build costs
// more than it protects — see issue #77, where the resume block /wrap is
// documented to write took master red for 18 days and held up a security fix
// for four. Nothing forces this output to be read; that is the accepted trade.
//
// Usage: node utility/lint-todo.mjs [path]   (default: TODO.md)
