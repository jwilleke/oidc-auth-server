├── middleware/       # Express middleware or similar
├── utils/           # Utility functions and helpers

```

## Directory Conventions

- controllers/ - Handle incoming requests and orchestrate responses
- services/ - Contain business logic, database operations, external API calls
- models/ - Data structures, interfaces, type definitions
- middleware/ - Authentication, logging, error handling, validation
- utils/ - Pure functions, helpers, shared utilities
- types/ - TypeScript interfaces and types (can also inline in files if small)

## Technology Stack

- Runtime: Node.js (v18+)
- Language: TypeScript (strict mode, ESM)
- Package Manager: npm
- Testing: Vitest
- Linting: ESLint 9 (flat config) + Prettier + Markdownlint
- Dev runner: tsx (ESM-native TypeScript execution)
- Hooks: Husky + lint-staged

## Configuration Files

- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration (strict mode, ESM)
- `tsconfig.build.json` - Build-only config (excludes test files)
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint rules (flat config)
- `vitest.config.ts` - Test runner configuration
- `.prettierrc.json` - Prettier rules for code formatting
- `.env` - Environment variables (not committed)
- `package.json` - Project metadata and scripts

## Naming Conventions

See [CODE_STANDARDS.md](./CODE_STANDARDS.md#naming-conventions) for complete naming conventions.

## Code Quality Standards

See [CODE_STANDARDS.md](./CODE_STANDARDS.md) for all code quality standards including TypeScript configuration, linting rules, formatting, testing requirements, and guiding principles.

## Development Workflow

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the complete development workflow including branching strategy, making changes, testing, and pull request process.

## Security Considerations

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for comprehensive security guidelines including secret management, input validation, database security, authentication practices, and OWASP compliance.
